0: 0x00 ("field id")

A: checksum for channel 1 and 2
B: checksum for channel 3
C: ethernet CRC

Fields (meaning for sender):
1: My time is xxx when I sent this package (in nanoseconds since some arbitrary epoch)
2: I received your time xxx (in field-id 1) in your last package
3: My time was xxx when I got your last package with time
4: You shall step your time to match mine with xxx (signed, 64bit)
5: Adjust your clock-rate xxx ppm (signed)
6: I had a buffer overrun of xxx samples
7: I had a buffer underrun of xxx samples
8: I received xxx samples with bad crc
9: I can play xxx channels of audio
10: I have xxx rec-channels
11: My sample clock is xxx Hz
12: Set your sample clock to xxx Hz
13: My buffersize is xxx frames
14: My buffer is xxx frames full
15: Audio in this packet starts at time xxx
16: Audio in this packet was recorded at time xxx
17: Command buffer overflow

Registers:
	Time-register:
		74 bit. in 1024ths of nanoseconds
		For example on a 50Mhz, this register
		is increased with 20*1024 every clock-cycle
		With adjusted clock 50Mhz + 15.625ppm, this
		register is increased 20*1024+16 every clock cycle

Frame-clock: edges everytime the time-register
